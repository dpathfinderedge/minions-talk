# Minion's Talk
# Live Project: https://minionschat.netlify.app
So basically, **Minions' Talk** is a converter that translates English Language into Minionese(a languge spoken by Minions, sometimes called Banana Language).

To speak it you must take the first letter of every word, move it to the end, and then say '-erb'; though two-letter words stay the same.
